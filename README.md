I recreated an old JavaScript color-guessing game called Color Clash, giving it a modern structure and style. The game challenges players to guess the correct color based on displayed RGB values, with multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) that affect the number and similarity of the color options. The project includes a responsive interface built with HTML and CSS, as well as an updated JavaScript logic that handles random color generation, user interaction, and game state management. This remake keeps the original fun concept but improves readability, maintainability, and overall user experience.
